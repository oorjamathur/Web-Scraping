### Overview

I scraped `https://www.worldometers.info/` website to get `country`, `year` and `population` using a really cool scraping library SCRAPY.

### Use

Being in the data domain, one is required to not only explore the already existing data but also create the dataset.
This is my attempt to contribute to the large open source community of data scientists, who can perform their regression analysis on the dataset I created.
I'll be uploading the dataset on Kaggle too.

### Technical Aspect

I used `Scrapy` to design a Spider from basic template of Scrapy and extracting country, year and population.

### Technologies Used

`Scrapy`
